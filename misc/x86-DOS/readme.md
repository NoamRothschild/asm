# x86-Dos

The files here are written for an x86 enviorment like windows 3.1 and can be ran on modern hardware using [DosBox](https://www.dosbox.com/).

Files are written in TASM and can be compiled using the next commands:

```bash
tasm /zi FILENAME.asm
tlink /v FILENAME.obj
FILENAME.exe
```

A basic enviornment setup guide [can be found here](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-run-TASM-and-Compile-x86-Assembly-Program-i/)
